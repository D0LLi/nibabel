Roadmap
=======

The roadmap is intended for larger, fundamental changes to the project that are
likely to take months or years of developer time. Smaller-scoped items will
continue to be tracked on our issue tracker.

The scope of these improvements means that these changes may be controversial,
are likely to involve significant discussion among the core development team,
and may require the creation of one or more NIAPs (Nibabel Increased
Awesomeness Proposals).
